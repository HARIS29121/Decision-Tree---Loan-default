# Decision Tree-Loan-default
We are going to build a model that predicts if someone who seeks a loan might be a defaulter or a non-defaulter. We have several independent variables like, checking account balance, credit history, purpose, loan amount etc. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Model built using Decision Tree and performed ensemble learning methods like (Bagging, AdaBoosting, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest) to check the perfomance of the model.
